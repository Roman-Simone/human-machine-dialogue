# Project description

**LLamaFit** is a human-machine dialogue system designed to help users plan and manage their workout programs. It provides **personalized training schedules, exercise recommendations, and favorite exercise management**, acting as a virtual personal trainer. You can find the demo of the video in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCRVmeRVNLE">link</a>.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Personalized Workout Plans** – Generate structured training schedules based on user input.  
✅ **Exercise Recommendations** – Find specific exercises based on body part, difficulty level, and available equipment.  
✅ **Favorite Exercises Management** – Add, remove, and list favorite exercises for quick access.  
✅ **User Interaction** – Provides clear and coherent responses while maintaining conversational flow.  
✅ **Feedback Collection** – Allows users to evaluate the system and provide improvement suggestions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
LLamaFit is built using **LLama 3**, running locally with **Ollama**, and follows a structured conversational pipeline:

1️⃣ **NLU (Natural Language Understanding):** Extracts user intent and relevant details (slots).  
2️⃣ **DM (Dialogue Manager):** Keeps track of the conversation state and selects the next best action.  
3️⃣ **NLG (Natural Language Generation):** Generates human-like responses based on the retrieved information.
